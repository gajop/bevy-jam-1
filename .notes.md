Theme: Unfair advantage

Ideas:

- Unfair GRTS
  - You are randomly given a small/big, strong/weak, advanced/backwards nation
  - It can be real time or turn based
  - It can be online or local

- Unfair GRTS
  - Online, turn-based multiplayer
  - Two turns a day, resets at 12:00 and 24:00 Japan time
  - Everyone is on the same map
  - Stars are generated in clusters, originating from a single center
    - Each cluster "belongs" to one player (i.e. it's closest for them so most likely to be obtained by them)
    - You can take ownership of stars with Army
    - Owned stars will have:
      - Immobile: Production (capacity), Mining (capacity), Owned Resources and Defence
      - Mobile: Army, Owned Resources
    - You can also build bridges between stars you own to make travel faster
    - Unowned stars have:
      - Resources, color, size (make it a factor of resources so it stands out?)
    - You can build:
      - Army:
        - Cost: x
        - Production cost: x
        - Move: 1
        - Strength: 1
      - Defence:
        - Cost: x
        - Production cost: x
        - Strength: 5
      - Production:
        - Cost: x
        - Efficiency: x^2 (efficiency scaling better than cost would encourage people to centralize building)
      - Mining capacity: just a number. Controls how much you can mine from the star.
        - Efficiency: x / (10 + x) % of total star resources
        - Cost: x^2
      - Hyperspace Bridges:
        - Contorls how many units can fast travel
        - Fast travel is 5x normal travel speed
        - If army size is greater than hyperspace bridge then it will move faster by Bridge Size / ArmySize speed
      - Resource transfer: possible to setup between stars for free. Will use bridges by default
      - All of the above can be destroyed in an attack. Order of attack is: Defence -> Army -> Infra. Infra is instantly destroyed (too punishing?)
  - Unfairness: Initial population, number of nearby stars and population can vary greatly



- Roadmap:
  - Win condition: own 90%+ of map
  - Lose condition: own nothing
  - Restart
  - Fleet
    - Make Fleet fly around planet
    - Rotate fleet flying to planet
  - Display current score (in planets owned)
